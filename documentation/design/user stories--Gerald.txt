User stories for accommodations’s services——Gerald

As a tourist I want to be given the accommodation location before I travel so that I can make a plan of going sightseeing surrounding my living place.
success:The system should show a map and GPS to users,include the name of street and road,the  landscapes or interest of places nearby,and some small stores and so forth.
Failure:The system is unable to show where the accommodation is or it just shows the accommodation without any other  good places.

As a tourist I want to know the price of accommodation and be given suggestions on which room is the most comfortable and suitable.
success:The system should make a list of all the rooms and hotels and compare them in price,environment,facilities and so on.Then,it should give users a suggestion and help users choose a room.
Failure:The system does not compare the price and other information of rooms,and it does not give any suggestions,either.

As a tourist I want to know if there are some extra services when I live in the accommodation,such as make a discount,include breakfast,give something as a present,or something like that,so that I can decide whether I choose this hotel or not.
Success:The system should post some activities for users and some other services and so forth,in order to let users recognise it is really great for them.
Failure:The system posts nothing else and users are unable to check it.
