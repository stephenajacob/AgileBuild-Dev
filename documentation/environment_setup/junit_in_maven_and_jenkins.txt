Running junit tests in maven build
	To write & execute junit tests in our maven build we need a few things
		The junit dependency to have the junit code.
		the maven-surefire-plugin to execute the junit tests.

junit dependency
	Add the following xml to the dependency section of our pom
		<dependency>
			<groupId>junit</groupId>
			<artifactId>junit</artifactId>
			<version>4.12</version>
		</dependency>

maven-surefire-plugin
	https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/
	Add the xml in the usage page to our pom


Publishing junit reports in Jenkins
	We need to install the junit jenkins plugin to allow Jenkins to read the junit results and generate a report
	http://ec2-52-18-72-132.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8081/
	Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins -> Available -> CTRL+F and search for the plugin you want -> Tick the box beside it and click "Download now and install after restart"
	SSH onto AWS EC2 instance and restart Jenkins
		The instructions to ssh onto an AWS EC2 instance are in my other tutorial
		once on the server run "sudo service jenkins restart"
	In this case we don't need to do any configuration in the job to generate and show the report.
